## How to run

1. Clone and cd into the repo
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (you may need root privileges; if so, `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run `./spacegame.py`

## Controls

A or D to move sidewards. Space to fire.

You can change the framerate, resolution, and music by amending `settings.json`.

## Assets

The enemy ships were created in Blender. I created the music using an online synthesizer.
