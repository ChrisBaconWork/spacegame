# Spacegame

This is the canonical spacegame where you shoot things.

## How to run

1. Clone and cd into the repo
2. Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` (you may need root privileges; if so, `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run `./spacegame.py`

## Assets

I shamelessly stole the "assets" from google.
